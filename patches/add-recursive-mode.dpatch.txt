Daniel Sch√ºssler has sent this patch to me

His explanation (translated by me):
(1)
new option -r: create tag files for each subdirectory
The idea behind it is to use the order of tag files to give tags priorities.
Example: ./tags,../tags (./tags is preferred over ../tags)

(2)
improve speed of nubBy
I haven't applied the patch yet for several reasons:
- can the same be achieved by a simple shell script?
- Should the "sorting" of tags be done in editors?
  Eg:
  https://github.com/MarcWeber/SmartTag
- He stopped replying while me asking whether I should change to git
  so that multiple branches can coexist at the same time easily.
- the speed improvement maybe can be done in a different way using Maps instead
  of lists so that no sorting or nubBy has to take place at all

Vote for the patch or the feature to make me include it.
Vote for me changing to git or tell me if there is a nicer way to distribute an
idea like this?
