hasktags: a tool to generate tag files for vim and emacs

  What is it for? A tag file is a index containing key items of your project such as
  - function names
  - module names
  - data declarations
  - ...

  so that you can find / jump to them fast.

HOWTO (GENERATING TAG FILES):
  Build hasktags (standard cabal build)

  I've been using this bash function or something similar for a long time.
  It may be cumbersome but works:

  runHaskTagsVim() {
          # use --etags instead of --ctags for emacs
          hasktags --ignore-close-implementation --ctags .; sort tags
  }

HOWTO (USING TAG FILES):
  VIM: let tags+=tagfile " tags,TAGS is the default setting so probably you don't have to do anything
       :tjump foo<tab> or such. See :h tags
  
  NEdit:
	Load the "tags" file using File/Load Tags File.
	Use "Ctrl-D" to search for a tag.

  XEmacs/Emacs:
	Load the "TAGS" file using "visit-tags-table"
	Use "M-." to search for a tag.

  jedit:
        There is a plugin
	


run test cases:
  cd testcases; sh test.sh


history:
In the past this tool was distributed with ghc. I forked and added some
features.  hasktags itself was moved out of the ghc repository. Then I only
verified that my fork finds at least as much tags as the one forked by Igloo.

Things which could be done in the future:
- make json support optional
- Marco Túlio Pimenta Gontijo proposed replacing json by aeson because it might
  be faster
- write a nice README.md file instead

maintainers: See cabal file

alex no longer supports bird style ">", so should we drop support, too?
